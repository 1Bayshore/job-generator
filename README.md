# job-generator
This is a program to create hilarous tasks from a list of mudane jobs. There is an example file for you to load in example.txt which containds a long list of jobs and a smaller list of highlighted jobs.
## Highlighting
Highlighting can be used to select specifically funny jobs for later use. To highlight a job, just type `h` in the console. It will highlight the most recently generated job. To use only highlighted jobs, enter `mode` into the console. To stop using highlighted jobs, simply type `mode` again.

Thank you, and have fun...as long as you oil the space heater.
